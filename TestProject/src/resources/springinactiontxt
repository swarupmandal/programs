1. AOP DEF - > Aspect oriented programming is a programming technique that promotes separation of concerns within a software system.

2. page 35 - > BeanFactory beanFactory = new XmlBeanFactory("c:/beans.xml");
			   This simple line of code tells the BeanFactory to load the xml file and read bean definitions from the xml file.But it
			   doesn't instantiate beans immediately means when read xml beans are lazily loaded into BeanFactory. Means while
			   load xml immediately the beans doesn't load themselves until it is needed.
			   To get bean object from BeanFactory we have to call getBean() method. then BeanFactory will instantiates and dispense
			   bean objects with bean properties using DI and start life cycle of of the bean within Spring Container.    
			  	

3. page 36 - > [Difference] - A BeanFactory is fine for Small applications but to get original power we have to use ApplicationContext.
			   On the surface an ApplicationContext is much same as BeanFacory. Both load xml read definition collaborating beans
			   and dispense them when request comes. But ApplicationContext provide more advanced features
			 
			   i)   It supports functionality to resolve textual messages and support Internationalization.
			   ii)  It provides generic way to load file resources.
			   iii) It publish events to beans which are registered as listeners.
			   iv)  Another big difference is how singleton beans are loaded. BeanFactory loads all beans lazyli means when it read and load xml it doesn't instantiate
			   		all beans, its instantiate when request come.
					But ApplicationContext is bit intelligent it loads all the singleton beans upon context startups. So if any singleton bean
					will require in application then application doesn't need to wait to instantiate of that singleton bean.
					 			   		 
			 
4. page 37 - > There are normally three types of ApplicationContext is commonly used
			 
			   i)   ClassPathXmlApplicationContext  -> Loads a context definition from ClassPath.
			   ii)  FileSystemXmlApplicationContext ->	Loads Context definition from FileSystem.
			   iii) XmlWebApplicationContext -> Loads a context File that contained in a web application.
			 
5. 			   The difference between is that FileSystemXmlApplicationContext will find xml file in the particular location of the file system.
			   And ClassPathXmlApplicationContext will find xml file anywhere in the class path including jar files.
			   

6. page 38 - > Beans Life of beans scope.

			   A BeanFactory performs several setup steps before it is ready to use.
			   
			   Instantiate > Populate Properties > BeanNameAware's setBeanName() > BeanFactoryAwre's setBeanFactory() > 
			   
			   PreinitializationBeanPostProcessor > Initializing Bean AfterPropertiesSet() > Call Custom init method >
			   
			   PostInitializationBeanPostProcessor >[Bean is ready to use] ----> [Container is SuhtDown] >
			   
			   Disposable Bean Destroy() >call custom destroy method
			   
			   
			   STEPS TAKEN IN THE LIFECYCLE OF THE BEAN
			   
			   i)    Instantiate - > Spring instantiate the bean
			   
			   ii)   Populate Properties - > Spring injects the beans properties.
			   
			   iii)  Set Bean Name - > If the bean implements BeanNameAwre, Spring passes id to set beanName();
			   
			   iv)   Set bean Factory - > If the bean implements BeanFactoryAwre then spring passes the
			   		 beanFactory to setBeanFactory
			   		 
			   v)	 PostProcessor(before initialization) - > if there are any BeanPostProcessor bean calls there
			    	 postProcessorBeforeInitialization method.
			    	 
			   vi)   Initialize beans - > if a bean implements InitializingBean, afterPropertiesSet() will be called, if
			    	 any other custom init method declared then that method will be called.
			    
			   vii)  Postprocess After initialization -> If there is any BeanPostProcessors then Spring will called postProcessAfterInitialization()
			    
			  viii)	 Bean Is Ready to use - > At this point bean is ready to use and if it is not called from anywhere in application then
			         it will remain same.	 
			         
			         
7. page 41 - > 		The <bean/> element is the most basic Configuration unit in spring framework. It tells spring to create an object of them.
